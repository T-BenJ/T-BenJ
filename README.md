- 👋 Hi, I’m Tangthai
- 👀 I’m a creative soul diving into the world of web development! I’m all about creating digital stories and bringing ideas to life through code.
- 🌱 By day, I’m a Creative/Director ; by night, I’m learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to become a full-stack developer.
- 💞️ I’d love to team up on projects that spark creativity, whether it’s frontend design, interactive web content, or digital storytelling.
- 📫 How to reach me : tangthai.benjakorn@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: Tangthai/Ben
- ⚡ Fun fact: I’m all about blending art and tech! When I'm not coding, you'll find me lost in a good book, drawing up new ideas, or vibing to some tunes.
